                h1 Mission
                p Provide a platform to centralize all talents, skills, and businesses so that users can search through one single directory and specifically the service that they seek. We want to isolate these categories away from search engines so that users don't have to deal with irrelevant search results, SEO, and marketing. In addition, we want to provide a way for users to grow their business by allowing other users to rate and review their portfolio.

                h1 Values
                p At M-ploy, service to our users is number one priority and we expect users to treat and respect each other as if they would to people in real life. Each user's profile act as a business and identity to the user and it is important not to make false claims, defamation, and/or fraud against the user. Our support and management team are always on stand by to handle and investigate issues reported by our users. We believe that, a quick response and solution plays an important role in customer satisfaction.

                h1 Who? When? and What?
                p M-ploy was created on August 9th, 2018 by Roger Chin who is the founder and the sole developer. Ever since Roger started a two-year IT program at 
                    a(href='https://www.bcit.ca') British Columbia Institution of Technology
                    | , Roger found his passion to become a full stack web developer. After completing the program, it was difficult to get into a junior web developer position. As a result and inspired by his college projects, Roger envisioned a PaaS that will bring all talents, skills, and businesses out of the massive world-wide web's search engine and together into one centralized application.
