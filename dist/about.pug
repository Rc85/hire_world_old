                    p Often times, local business or self-employed individuals go unnoticed because they lack the ability or knowledge to market themselves. These fall under the fact that they either don't know how big social media is, don't have money to hire a web developer to create a website, or find marketing on the internet confusing. M-ploy is aimed fix all of these for its users by providing a platform to advertise themselves without knowledge of web development, without having to pay hefty percent per project fees, and allow users to get their business recognized locally and internationally.

                    p At M-ploy, service to our users is number one priority and we expect users to treat and respect each other as if they would to people in real life. Each user's profile act as a business to the user and it is important not to make false claims and/or fraud against the user.

                    p M-ploy plans to expand its platform to cater not only to users who provide services, but also users that have products to sell. An example is a real estate agent who have a list of properties they wish to sell. We would like to implement a product page that allow image uploading and reviewing of the product.
                    p M-ploy also plans to implement a calendar system to allow users who have service to track their appointments. For example, a chiropractor can allow customers to sign up for an appointment without the chiropractor to manually note down the appointment.
                    p M-ploy has long term vision of its service and so, on-going improvements to current features are constantly being implemented.

                    h1 The Who? When? and Why?
                    p M-ploy was created on August 9th, 2018 by Roger Chin. He is the founder, CEO, and the sole developer of M-ploy. Ever since Roger started a two-year IT program at 
                        a(href='https://www.bcit.ca') British Columbia Institution of Technology
                        | , Roger found his passion to become a full stack web developer. After completing the program, Roger created an online portfolio in hopes to get his talent known. However, with hundreds, if not thousands of others in the same city and talent as him, it's extremely difficult to be the one that stands out. And so M-ploy was created to centralize all individuals with talents in one search-able site. At M-ploy, users will find jobs and clients will find their candidate to fulfill a role or complete a project.
