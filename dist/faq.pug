                    b How does upgrading or downgrading my subscription work?
                    .answer
                        p When you upgrade your subscription, your billing cycle resets to the day you upgrade, you get all the features of the upgraded plan, and you will get a credit from your previous subscription that you paid for.

                        p For example, if you subscribed to a $7/month plan on January 1, 2018 and you decide to upgrade to a $15/month plan on January 15, 2018. You will receive $3.50 credit on your next bill.
                    
                        p When you downgrade your subscription, the new plan you downgraded to will take affect when your current subscription ends.

                    b What is the Offset Fee?
                    .answer
                        p The Offset Fee is applied because Stripes take fees from the final charge. For example, when a user subscribes to a $7 plan, we have to add 2.9% and $0.30 to the price which equals to $7.50. However, Stripes charges 2.9% on the final charge of $7.50, which equates to about $0.22, that is where the Offset Fee of $0.02 come from. We can assure you that M-ploy takes no more or less than $7 for our plans.

You will still be required to fill in your country and region so that your listing will still show up when users filter the listing by country and/or region.
